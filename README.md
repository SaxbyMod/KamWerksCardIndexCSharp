### Where is data pulled from?

* The Wiki: https://inscryption-pvp-wiki.notion.site/70261252cdb34b65a8658446d59bbd1e?v=98a75b925dcd4c5eb8f7e6ae68ed1b67
* The Asset Dump for the Wiki: https://github.com/SaxbyMod/NotionAssets
* Kam Werks Specific Asset Dump: https://github.com/SaxbyMod/KamWerksPortraitsAndOtherAssets

### Rough Down Time;

* Between ~10-12am-3:00pm roughly this is because its ran while my PC is on, and thus forth ran locally as I dont have a dedicated server for my bot yet.

### How could I contribute;

* If you don't know code feel free to help with the wiki, and if you do know code, making some PRS with improvements would be fantastic [Code Base](https://github.com/SaxbyMod/KamWerksCardIndexCSharp)
